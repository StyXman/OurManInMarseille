This is a simple random slideshow program made in one morning with PyQt4. Here's
the usage:

    omim.py ROOT SECONDS

    ROOT points to the root directory where the images are going to be picked up.
    SECONDS is the time between images.

Not much more to say, except that you should check out the [TODO list](TODO.md).
